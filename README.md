# taptapfrenzy
Minigame written for 67-328 using HTML5 Canvas

In this assignment, I built a game called Tap Tap Frenzy using the HTML5 canvas. The rules are simple: simply tap on the circles that light up as fast as you can, and try to see how many circles you can tap without missing any. To make things more challenging, there will also be red herrings/circles that you must not tap, otherwise the game is over.
